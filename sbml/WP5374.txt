TGFbeta/Smad Signaling Pathway in Trabecular Meshwork. In this pathway, TGF-beta binds to TGF-beta type II receptor, inducing the activation of the TGF-beta type I receptor. This induces the phosphorilation of Smad2/3 proteins which form a complex with Smad4. The translocation of this complex to the nucleous is facilitated by TAZ protein. Once in the nucleous, it binds to SBEs (Smad Binding Elements, promoting the transcrption of TGF-beta-response genes. Under pathological conditions, this pathway is overestimulated leading to the modification of TM features and accumulation of ECM proteins in the cytoplasm.
