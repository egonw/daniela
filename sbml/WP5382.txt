Regulation of TGFβ/Smad Signaling Pathway in Trabecular Meshwork (TM) cells. In this pathway, TGF-β binds to the TGF-β-type II receptor, inducing the activation of the TGF-β-type-I receptor. This induces the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 proteins which form a complex with Smad4. The translocation of this complex to the nucleus is facilitated by the TAZ protein.  Once in the nucleous, it binds to SBEs (Smad Binding Elements), promoting the transcription of TGF-beta-response genes. The inhibition of this translocation instead occurs when phosphorylated TAZ protein interacts with 14-3-3 protein preventing the formation of complex TAZ-Smad. 
The translated ECM proteins are secreted by TM cells to the extracellular space.
